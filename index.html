      <p>2015 was the 120th season in school history. They finished the season 6-7 overall and 3-6 in Big 12 play to finish in eighth place. K-State football
      rattled off 3 straight wins against South Dakota, UTSA, and Louisiana Tech. K-State then lost their next 5 games with their most notable loss coming from a 0-55
      showing at Oklahoma. After dropping 5 straight, K-State won their last 3 games to become bowl eligible. The season was doomed from the start
      as starting Quarterback, Sophomore Jesse Ertz, hurt his knee in the opening game of the season and was ruled out for the season.
      The Quarteback position was shared between backup Joe Hubener and Senior Wide Reciever, Kody Cook. 
      They were invited to the Liberty Bowl where they lost to Arkansas 23-45.</p>

      <p>The Wildcats were led by head coach Bill Snyder in his 25th overall and eighth straight season since taking over for his second tenure in 2009. 
      Coming off a lost Sophomore season, Jesse Ertz won back the starting Quarteback role and played in all 13 games. Ertz let the Wildcats in the air and 
      on the ground with a team leading 1,012 rushing yards. It was a shared backfield of Charles Jones, Justin Silmon, and Alex Barnes. K-Sate opened up their
      2016 campaign with a loss to Stanford in Palo Alto. K-State finished the year with a 9-4 record and a bid to the Texas Bowl where they defeated former

      <p>in January 2017 it was reported by many Kansas media outlets that Bill Snyder has been traveling to Houston, Texas for treatment 
      for a "serious life-threatening ailment". On February 12, 2017 Snyder announced that he has been diagnosed with throat cancer and had been 
      receiving treatment in Manhattan, as well at University of Kansas Medical Center, and in Houston, Texas. The starting
     Quarterback role was shared between Jesse Ertz, Alex Delton, and Skylar Thompson. Senior Alex Barnes led the Wildcats in rushing yards. K-State's loss
     in Nashville against SEC bottom-feeder Vanderbilt sent doubt into the KSU fanbase as the season went on. With an average season at best and a solid road 
     win against #10 Okalahom State towards the end of the season, K-State finsished the season with a 8-5 record and defeated the UCLA Bruin in the Cactus Bowl.  </p>

    <p>The 2018 season started with a rocky start. K-State opened the season at home with a nail-biting win against FCS opponent, South Dakota. Losing
    12-24 going into the 4th quarter, the Wildcats were saved by a 85 yard punt return by Isaiah Zuber and a 10 yard touchdown pass to Zuber from Quarterback 
    Skylar Thompson. The Coyotes could of sent the game into over-time but the field goal was missed by their kicker. The 'Cats finished the season 
    with a 5-7 record and missed bowl season for the first time 
    since the 2010 season. On December 2 Snyder, who had signed a five-year extension before the season began, announced his retirement. 
    His final record was 215-117-1 in 27 seasons. On December 10, North Dakota State head coach Chris Klieman was hired as Snyder's successor.</p>

    <p>The Wildcats were led by first-year head coach Chris Klieman, who accepted the role after the retirement of long-time head coach Bill Snyder.
    KSU opened up the season with a blow-out win against Nichols State, a 52-0 no-doubter against Bowling Green, and an impressive road win against Mississippi State
    whom the Wildcats lost to in Bill Snyder Family Stadium the previous season. K-State shocked #5 Oklahoma in Manhattan and reached #20 in the polls during the season.
